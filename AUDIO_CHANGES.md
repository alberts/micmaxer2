# Audio Input Level Reading Changes

## Overview
Modified the application to read input volume levels directly from macOS system settings instead of capturing audio samples.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created `audio_darwin.go`
- Uses Core Audio APIs through CGO to read input device volume
- Reads the `kAudioDevicePropertyVolumeScalar` property from the default input device
- Also checks mute state using `kAudioDevicePropertyMute`
- Returns volume as percentage (0-100) without any audio capture

### 2. Created `audio_other.go`
- Stub implementation for non-macOS platforms
- Returns an error indicating the feature is only supported on macOS

### 3. Modified `main.go`
- Replaced audio capture implementation in `getAudioInputLevel()`
- Now calls `getSystemInputLevel()` which reads from device settings
- Removed `unsafe` and `time` imports that are no longer needed

## Benefits
- No audio capture required - just reads the device settings
- Much faster response time (instant vs 100ms capture delay)
- Lower CPU usage - no audio processing
- No microphone permissions required

## Limitations
- Currently only works on macOS
- Uses deprecated Core Audio APIs (still functional but should be updated)
- Cannot detect actual audio levels, only the device volume setting

## Future Improvements
- Update to use modern Core Audio APIs
- Add support for other platforms (Windows, Linux)
- Add ability to monitor volume changes in real-time
